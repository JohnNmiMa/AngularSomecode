AngularJS Design
1) SomeCodeCtrl - general app controller
2) Header
    * HeaderCtrl - the header controller
    * snippet-search directive
3) TopicPanel
    * TopicPanelCtrl - the topicbar controller
    * topicPanel directive
    * topic directive
4) SnippetBar
    * SnippetBarCtrl - the snippetbar controller
5) SnippetContainer
    * SnippetContainerCtrl - the snippet container controller
    * snippet directive
    * snippet-selector directive
    * SnippetService - makes $http calls to the server
    * SnippetSort - a filter to display the snippets

* The header is in all views
* The ng-view contains the TopicBar, SnippetBar
   and SnippetContainer

!- Implement CodeMirror Snippet Code Text-Area
  - investigate other code input tools
!- Implement Snippet Description/Note Text-Area
  - Add WYSYWIG JavaScript HTML editor for snippet description text-area

    One of the keys to this entire app is to provide a great code and
    description input experience. The description area must offer the following:
     * Bullets: bullets need to be indented properly.
     * Numbered lists, where numbers can be started and then continued from where
       they were left off. Just starting at "1" each time a numbered list is started
       is bad.

       Here is an example how bullets and numbered lists should be rendered:

          Some paragraph text that will contain bulleted and numbered items:
          1) Item one.
             * This is a bullet
             * This is another bullet. This is a long bullet that will demonstrate
               proper bullet text wrapping and indentation.

          2) Item two. Notice that the numbering continued onto two, and did not start over to one.
             a) Sub-item 2.1
             b) Sub-item 2.2
                * This is the first bullet to sub-item 2.2
                * This is the second bullet
                  - This is an indented bullet. The bullet could be another symbol to help
                    show the different level. Also, notice how the bullet text displays
                    proper bullet text wrapping and indentation.
                  - Another indented bullet.

          3) Item three. Notice how the numbering can be continued even though the previous numbering
             was interrupted by a list of bulleted items.

!- Implement backend DB that will persist on heroku - OR
  Deploy Flask server to a python service that will work with SQLite. - choose this!
